# MAE598_Project: Self Landing Rocket
Steven Elliott


Introduction:
	
I started off with a 2D rocket landing game where the user had 3 input controls: thrust, torque right, and torque left.  The objective was to land on the platform in the middle of the screen within +-30degrees and with low vertical velocity.  The system is modelled below.

From there I decided I wanted to attemp to land the rocket using a neural network.
